Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in this project!

At the current stage, this repository consists entirely of code and files that I have written. For now, contributions will be reviewed and added solely by me.

If you have ideas, suggestions, or find issues, please feel free to open an Issue in the repository. That way I can track feedback and consider it for future updates.

Once the project has grown and stabilized, I may open it up for direct pull requests and broader contributions.
